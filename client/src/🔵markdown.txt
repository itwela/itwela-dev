# SUMMARY
JobKompass is a web and mobile-friendly application that helps users gain valuable insights into what's working for them in their job search. This project was born out of necessity because I needed something better than just a spreadsheet to keep up with all of my job applications. I needed a toolkit. A resource. Something to help me with cover letters, follow-up messages to people once I finished the job, etc. and that's what sparked the interest and development of this project.
