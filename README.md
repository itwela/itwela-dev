Hello,
I'm Itwela.
(ee - tway - la)

I am a software engineer currently based in Atlanta, GA. I'm deeply immersed in the world of code, with a focus in React, Python, and Java. Majority of my work is open-source and available on Github. You can also connect with me on Linkedin where I post about my professional journey and growth as a developer.


In this repsitory you will find the source code for this website.

Outside of programming and school, I enjoy producing music, green tea, trading and reading (memoirs, self-help, and manga are some of favorites).
